# 🤝 Contributing to OSS Executor

Welcome to the OSS Executor project! We're excited you're here and interested in contributing. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or just asking a good question — you're helping improve a tool that's fully open, community-driven, and built for developers like you.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To contribute, you'll first want to get the project running locally. Here's the quick path:

1. **Fork the Repository**  
   Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repo, then clone your fork:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/oss-executor.git
   cd oss-executor
    ```
Install Requirements & Build
Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/Open-Source-Softworks/OSS-Exec/blob/main/README.md) to set up your build environment.
We recommend Visual Studio (Windows) with C++17+ support.

Create a Branch
Always create a feature branch before making changes:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-branch-name
```
# Make Changes and Commit
Try to make atomic, meaningful commits. Format code where necessary and leave helpful comments when appropriate.

# Push & Open a Pull Request
When you're ready, push your branch and open a pull request (PR) against the main branch.

## 🛠️ Contribution Types
There are lots of ways to help:
- 🐛 Bug Fixes – Found a crash, memory leak, or broken behavior? Help us squash it.
- ✨ New Features – Got an idea that fits OSS Executor's mission? Let’s see it!
- 📚 Documentation – Good docs make great projects. Typos, missing info, usage examples — it's all helpful.

🔍 Code Review – Feedback on existing PRs is always appreciated.

## To keep things clean and consistent:
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
- Match existing file structure and naming conventions.
- Stick to formatting rules (we use clang-format when applicable).
- Keep commits focused — one fix or feature per commit.
- Avoid large “mega-commits” that are hard to review.
- Prioritize readability over clever tricks.

## 🧪 Reporting Bugs
- Bug reports are extremely valuable. When reporting one, please include:
- A clear and specific title.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- What you expected vs. what actually happened.
- Your OS, system info, and OSS Executor version.
- Any logs, crash dumps, or screenshots that help illustrate the problem.
- Use the "Bug Report" issue template on GitHub for consistency.

## 💡 Suggesting Features
Got an idea to improve the executor? Open a new issue and use the "Feature Request" template. Include:
A short summary of the feature.
Why it would be helpful or necessary.
Any thoughts on implementation (optional).
We’ll review and discuss proposals openly with the community.

## ✅ Pull Request Checklist
Before submitting your PR, ensure:
 - The code compiles and runs without errors.
 - You’ve tested your changes locally.
 - Your branch is up-to-date with main.
 - Your PR clearly explains the purpose of the changes.
If your contribution is substantial, we may request a short write-up or demo.
